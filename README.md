# Music Player
### Playing MP3 & WAVE files from a local place on the Pc

A Python based project, which plays music using the "file" button on the application; moreover, you can choose the file type aswell.

The GUI is designed by QtDesigner.

Libraries: PyQt5, vlc, time

***Tip: I had difficulty, importing the vlc library i.e. I used the direct way to import vlc â†’ os.add_dll_directory(r'C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC')
